A sleep debt calculator. It helped me practice building functions with conditional statements.

## Challenges

The biggest challenge was setting up the calculation. I often got lost in the complexity of the condition I was trying to set. I'd take breaks to help refocus and "see" the errors in syntax.

## Takeaways

I'm sure functions are a common in programs. Finding the simplest ways to write them is important.
